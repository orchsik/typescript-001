 * [x] Magic string comparisons -> enum
 * [ ] Source of data is hardcoded
 * [ ] Data array is all strings, even though it might have numbers in it
 * [ ] Variable named after a specific team
 * [ ] Analysis type is fixed
 * [ ] No ability to output the report in diffrent formats
 */

 * Creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from TS to JS
 * Primary goal is to signal to other engineers that these are all closely related values
 * Use whenever we have small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at complie time
